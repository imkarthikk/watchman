Download this Repo\r\n2. Run `python setup.py install`\r\n3. Configure the app by running `watchman configure`. Or copy the [default YAML file](#yaml-config) to `~`.\r\n\r\n## Running Watchman\r\n1. From Terminal, run `watchman sync`\r\n2. From another Terminal, run `watchman worker`\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n* `watchman sync`: Watches over all paths added to `source` in [YAML configuration file](#yaml-config)\r\n* `watchman worker`: Starts the RQ worker to ping all endpoints added to `endpoints` in [YAML configuration file](#yaml-config)\r\n\r\n## YAML configuration\r\nThis YAML is automatically created in the `~` directory. It holds all the configuration attributes for Watchman.\r\n\r\n#### Attributes\r\n* `source`: Array of all paths Watchman should monitor\r\n* `regexes`: Array of all regexes Watchman should abide by (These regexes are matched with the filepath)\r\n* `endpoints`: Hash of each file/folder action which should ping to an API endpoint\r\n\r\n#### Default File\r\n```\r\n  source:\r\n    - /home/users/skcript\r\n  regexes:\r\n    - \"([a-zA-Z0-9_ -/]*)/home/(\\\\w+)/uploads/\"\r\n  endpoints:\r\n    file_create: \"http://localhost/api/v2/files/create\"\r\n    folder_create: \"http://localhost/api/v2/folders/create\"\r\n    file_move: \"http://localhost/api/v2/files/move\"\r\n    folder_move: \"http://localhost/api/v2/folders/move\"\r\n    file_destroy: \"http://localhost/api/v2/files/destroy\"\r\n    folder_destroy: \"http://localhost/api/v2/folders/destroy\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\nAll Watchman logs are maintained at `/tmp/watchman.log`\r\n\r\n## Extending\r\nWatchman can ratelimit and selectively prevent your API calls for each file\r\nsystem event. These are managed in `watchman/extension.py`. Each function defined\r\nin `extension.py` takes path (where the file system event occurred) as input.\r\n\r\n### Ratelimiting\r\nWatchman can ratelimit your API calls based on a unique string at 100 calls\r\nper second.\r\n\r\nThe unique string is used to group your API calls. Modify the `ratelimit()`\r\nfunction in `watchman/extension.py` to enable this. By default it returns the\r\nroot directory of the path Watchman is watching.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are monitoring `/uploads` folder which has directories for\r\neach user, like,\r\n- `/uploads/user1`\r\n- `/uploads/user2`\r\n- `/uploads/user3`\r\n\r\nModify `ratelimit()` to return the username from the path. This way you can\r\nratelimit API calls based on each user.\r\n\r\n### Preventing\r\nWatchman can selectively prevent API calls from being triggered by simply\r\nreturning a boolean for each path. Modify the `prevent()` function in\r\n`watchman/extension.py` to enable this.\r\n\r\nBy default `prevent()` returns `False` and does not prevent any API calls.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2016 Skcript.\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![Skcript](http://www.skcript.com/static/skcript_norm.png)\r\n\r\nWatchman is maintained and funded by Skcript.
